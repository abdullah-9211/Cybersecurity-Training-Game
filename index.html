    <h1>The Story of Murghi</h1>
    <div id="extra">
    <p>Once upon a time, in the village of dheetOville, lived a chicken named Murghi. One day Murghi stumbled upon an ancient map hinting at a hidden treasure.

      Excitement filled Murghis' feathers as the adventure began. Little did Murghi know that the road to the treasure was guarded by both physical and digital challenges. The mystical creatures of Cryptoville whispered about a magical Cipher Guardian who encrypted the path, ensuring only the cleverest could uncover the secrets.</p>
